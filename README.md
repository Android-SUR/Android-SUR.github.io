## Introduction
Our work focuses on studying slow UI responsiveness (SUR) for interactive mobile systems (especially for Android). To this end, as a major Android phone vendor, we conduct a large-scale crowd-sourced study with 47M Android phones to analyze SUR events. We deploy a continuous monitoring infrastructure to collect system-level traces upon the occurrence of SUR events through a customized Android system (dubbed Android-MOD). We then analyze the collected data and uncover multi-fold root causes of SUR events. To address the major root cause, we develop an effective solution by remodeling the process management of Android, which greatly reduces both SUR occurrence and battery consumption. This repository contains our released data, along with the implementation of continuous monitoring infrastructure and optimizations. Note that, our Android-MOD system is built upon vanilla Android 10/11/12 and Linux kernel 5.12/5.13/5.14. Therefore, youâ€™ll be able to run codes in this repo by patching these modifications to the proper framework and kernel components.

## Data Release
We have released a portion of the representative sample data (with proper anonymization) for reference [here](https://github.com/Android-SUR/Android-SUR.github.io/tree/main/data). As to the full dataset, we are still in discussion with the authority to what extent can it be released. We will make the rest dataset public as soon as possible after receiving the permission and desensitizing the dataset.

For each file in the dataset, we list the specific information coupled with the regarding description as follows.

## Codebase Organization
Currently, We have released a portion of the implementation code for reference [here](https://github.com/Android-SUR/Android-SUR.github.io/tree/main/code). For the full code, we are scrutinizing the codebase to avoid possible anonymity violations. After that, we will release the source code of this study as soon as we have finished examining it and acquired its release permission from the authority. The codebase is organized as follows.

```
code
|---- continuous monitor infrastructure
|---- remodeling
```
+ `continuous monitor infrastructure/` contains the source code of our continuous monitor infrastructure.
+ `remodeling/` includes several modules for remodeling the process management of Android (e.g., the uniform authentic sensing layer).


## Platform Requirements
### Linux
For modifications pertaining to Linux, our code is executed and validated on Linux kernel 5.12, 5.13, and 5.14. It's worth noting that, despite substantial revisions introduced in Linux kernel 5.13 and 5.14 relative to 5.12, our code remains compatible across these versions due to the consistency of specific tracing points and functions.

### Android
For Android-related modifications, our code is run and tested in Android 10, 11, and 12 (AOSP).
Note that although quite a number of changes have been made in Android 12/11 since Android 10, our code is applicable to both given that concerned tracing points remain unchanged.

## For Developers
Our code is licensed under Apache 2.0 in accordance with AOSPâ€™s and Kernelâ€™s licenses. Please adhere to the corresponding open-source policy when applying modifications and commercial uses. 
Also, some of our code is currently not available but will be released soon once we have obtained permission.
